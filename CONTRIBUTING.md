### ✨ Guidelines
* Keep explanations short and clear — beginners should understand
* Prefer code + explanation, not just theory
* Markdown only. Use ```python or ```yaml for code blocks
* Use headings (##), bullet points, and examples where helpful
* Avoid writing too academically. Be real. Be useful.
