# Vertex AI Pipelines

Vertex AI Pipelines lets you automate, orchestrate, and monitor ML and agent workflows using a managed, scalable, and reproducible pipeline service built on Kubeflow Pipelines.

In AI agent development, Pipelines are incredibly useful for managing the end-to-end agent lifecycle — including data prep, RAG dataset generation, model finetuning, agent testing, evaluation, and deployment.

---

### Why Use Pipelines for AI Agents?
AI agents are not just code—they are complex systems involving data ingestion, embedding, training, retrieval, evaluation, and monitoring. Pipelines help you:

- Automate these repetitive steps.
- Version and audit changes.
- Parallelize and scale tasks.
- Reuse components across projects (e.g., shared memory modules or chunkers).
- Create CI/CD systems for agents.

### Use Cases in Agent Projects
| Use Case       | Example                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Dataset Prep   | Crawl + clean + embed docs for RAG     |
| Agent Training | Fine-tune models or train custom tools |
| Deployment     | Deploy to Cloud Run or Vertex Endpoint |
| Evaluation     | Automated agent benchmarks             |
| Monitoring     | Inference latency or tool failure rate |

### Pipeline Components
Each step in a pipeline is called a component, written as a Python function or a container image. Typical components in an agent pipeline:

`load_data()`

`chunk_documents()`

`generate_embeddings()`

`store_to_vector_db()`

`evaluate_agent_response()`

`deploy_agent()`

**Basic Pipeline Structure (Python)**
```python
@dsl.component
def embed_documents_op(data_path: str) -> str:
    # Load + embed docs
    ...

@dsl.pipeline(name="agent-data-pipeline")
def pipeline(data_path: str):
    embedded_path = embed_documents_op(data_path)
    # Add more steps as needed

compiler.Compiler().compile(
    pipeline_func=pipeline,
    package_path='pipeline.json'
)
```
Run using:
```bash
gcloud ai pipelines run \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --display-name=agent-data-pipeline \
  --template-file=pipeline.json \
  --service-account=your-service-account
```

#### Integration with Other Services
- Use Vertex AI Workbench to author pipelines in notebooks.

- Use Vertex Model Monitoring as a downstream step.

- Store intermediate artifacts in Cloud Storage or BigQuery.

- Trigger pipelines with Cloud Build for CI/CD.

---
### When to Use
- You need to automate multi-step workflows.

- You want agent reproducibility and audit trails.

-  You plan to collaborate across teams or projects.

-  You want to build CI/CD pipelines for agents.

---

### Best Practices
- Break down workflows into reusable components.

- Keep steps modular and stateless.

- Use Artifact Registry to version pipeline components.

- Use Cloud Logging for debugging failures.

- Document all pipeline inputs and outputs.
