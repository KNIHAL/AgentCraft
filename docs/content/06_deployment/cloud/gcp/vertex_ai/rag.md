# üß†  RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in GCP
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an advanced AI pattern where an LLM is combined with an external knowledge base ‚Äî so it can retrieve context before generating answers. In AI agents, this is critical when handling dynamic, domain-specific, or private information that the base model doesn‚Äôt know.

**üìò What is RAG?**

Instead of asking an LLM to generate responses from its limited training data, RAG enhances it by:

- Retrieving relevant documents from a source (e.g., vector DB, search index)
- Feeding those documents into the prompt (context)
- Generating a grounded answer
>Think of RAG like "open-book exam mode" for LLMs.

### ‚úÖ Building a RAG Agent: Step-by-Step
**1. Ingest Data to Cloud Storage**

Store your raw documents (PDFs, articles, etc.) in a GCS bucket.
```bash
gsutil cp documents/*.pdf gs://my-rag-data/
```
**2. Choose Your Retrieval Layer**

You have two options:

a) Vertex AI Search (Enterprise Search with UI)

- Auto-structured ingestion
- Built-in search + chat
- Works well with enterprise data like docs, tables, PDFs

b) Vertex AI Vector Search (Custom embeddings search)

- Use for deeply customized or private vector-based search
- Requires you to embed your docs and index them

**3. Embed & Index Documents**

For Vector Search, you need to generate embeddings. Use:

- Vertex AI Embedding Models
- Or open-source like sentence-transformers

Once embedded:

- Store in Vector Store
- Or use Vertex Vector Search Indexes

**4. Query Handling in Agent**

On query:

- Generate embedding for user input
- Retrieve top-k documents
- Inject them into your prompt
- Call the model (Gemini or Vertex)

**Prompt Template Example:**
```css
You are a helpful assistant. Based on the following context, answer the user question.

Context:
{{retrieved_docs}}

User Question:
{{user_input}}
```

### üß™ Best Practices
- Keep chunk size between 200‚Äì500 tokens for better retrieval
- Use hybrid retrieval: full-text + vector
- Preprocess documents (remove headers, irrelevant text)
- Evaluate with tools like RAGAS (RAG Accuracy Score)

### üìä RAG Evaluation Metrics
| Metric              | Description                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Faithfulness        | Does the answer stay true to the retrieved content? |
| Answer relevancy    | Is the answer useful to the user?                   |
| Retrieval precision | Are retrieved docs actually helpful?                |
