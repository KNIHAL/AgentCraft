# üß∞ Agent Development Kit (ADK)

Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a set of open-source tools, APIs, and best practices for building intelligent agents that run on Vertex AI infrastructure. It gives developers more control, modularity, and production readiness compared to low-code options like Vertex AI Builder.

ADK is the recommended approach when building custom, extensible, production-grade AI agents on GCP.

### üõ†Ô∏è What You Can Build With ADK
- Gemini-powered agents with structured prompt flows
- Multi-step agents with memory, tools, and reasoning
- Customer support bots that query internal tools
- Domain-specific assistants (e.g., legal, medical, finance)
- RAG pipelines using Vertex AI Search or Vector Search
- Agents that call external APIs, trigger workflows, or write to databases

### üì¶ ADK + GCP Stack
| Task                        | GCP Service Used            |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Run your agent backend      | Cloud Run or GKE            |
| Store agent files & logs    | Cloud Storage + Logging     |
| Secure agent secrets        | Secret Manager              |
| Store agent memory or state | Firestore / Redis / AlloyDB |
| Handle auth & access        | IAM, Service Accounts       |
| Connect to LLMs / Gemini    | Vertex AI SDK               |

#### üöÄ Getting Started
1. Install the ADK
```bash
pip install google-agent-kit
```
Note: Replace with the actual package name once Google publicly releases it.

2. Define a Simple Agent
```python 
from adk import AgentBuilder, ToolExecutor

def greet_user(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}! How can I assist you today?"

agent = AgentBuilder(name="GreeterAgent")
agent.add_tool("greet", greet_user)
agent.set_prompt("Use the greet tool to welcome the user.")

response = agent.run({"user_input": "Nihal"})
print(response)
```
