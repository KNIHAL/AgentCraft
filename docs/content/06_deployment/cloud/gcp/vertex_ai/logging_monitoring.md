# Cloud Logging & Monitoring (for AI Agents)

Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring (formerly Stackdriver) are essential for observing, debugging, and optimizing AI agents in production. They let you track everything — from LLM outputs to tool calls, RAG performance, and latency — across GCP services like Cloud Run, Vertex AI, and more.

---

### Why It Matters for AI Agent Developers
An AI agent isn't just a model — it’s a living system with LLMs, tools, APIs, and user interactions. Logs and metrics help you:

- Debug broken flows (e.g., tool errors, LLM issues)
- Monitor latency & uptime
- Set alerts for failures or abnormal behavior
- Improve agent performance through data analysis

---
### Cloud Logging (Agent Debugging)
Cloud Logging captures real-time logs from:

- Vertex AI endpoints
- Cloud Run containers
- Custom Python agents
Log Examples for AI Agents:
```bash
INFO:tool-caller: Called GitHub Tool with input: 'create issue'
ERROR:tool-caller: Tool failed with status 500
INFO:rag-retriever: Found 3 docs from vector DB
DEBUG:llm: Generated reply in 2.1s
```
**Key Use Cases:**
- Track tool failures
- See user inputs & outputs
- Measure prompt generation time
- Log RAG search quality

---

### Cloud Monitoring (Performance & Alerts)
Cloud Monitoring lets you track:

- Agent response latency
- Error rates across flows
- CPU, memory usage (Cloud Run, VM)
- Custom metrics like user feedback score

### Sample Custom Metrics for AI Agents:
| Metric Name            | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `llm_response_latency` | Time taken by LLM to respond          |
| `tool_success_rate`    | Percentage of successful tool calls   |
| `rag_hit_ratio`        | How often RAG retrieved relevant info |
| `agent_user_feedback`  | Avg thumbs-up/down over time          |

#### How to Enable
**Step 1: Enable Logging & Monitoring**

These are auto-enabled for most GCP services like Cloud Run and Vertex AI.

**Step 2: Use Structured Logging in Your Code**

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger("agent")

logger.info("User asked to summarize email.")
logger.error("Tool failed: status=403")
```
**Step 3: View in Cloud Console**

- Logs Explorer for searching logs
- Dashboards for real-time metrics
- Alert Policies for failures (e.g., tool error > 5%)

----

### Best Practices
- Use structured logging with categories (llm, tool, rag, etc.)
- Log all external API/tool calls.
- Set up alerts for high error rate or slow response.
- Create dashboards to monitor agent health visually.
- Use log-based metrics to track non-standard KPIs (e.g., “agent stuck” counts).

### When to Use
- Every production AI agent.
- Whenever you're using Cloud Run, Vertex AI, or Cloud Functions.
- For debugging RAG pipelines, LLM prompts, or tool integrations.
