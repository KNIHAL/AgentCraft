# Vertex AI Vector Search

Vertex AI Vector Search is a fully managed, high-performance vector database offered by Google Cloud. It is optimized for use cases like semantic search, image similarity, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and recommendation systems, where you compare and retrieve results based on vector embeddings rather than keyword matches.

This is highly useful for AI agents that need to search or retrieve contextually similar data from a large knowledge base in real-time.

### Why Use Vector Search in Agent Development?
AI agents often work with large unstructured datasets — documents, emails, user inputs, codebases, etc. Vector search allows them to:

- Retrieve semantically relevant chunks of data using vector embeddings.
- Enhance LLM-based agents with accurate and fast context retrieval.
- Power RAG systems using structured vector queries.
- Reduce latency compared to self-managed vector DBs.

### Key Features
- Multi-node distributed serving
- Automatic indexing and scaling
- Integration with Vertex AI models and embeddings
- Filterable and hybrid search support
- Fully managed and serverless

### Workflow to Use Vector Search
**Step 1: Generate Embeddings**

You can use Google’s own embedding models or external models (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face) to convert your data (text, images, etc.) into vector format.

```python
from vertexai.language_models import TextEmbeddingModel
model = TextEmbeddingModel.from_pretrained("textembedding-gecko")
embedding = model.get_embeddings(["What is AI?"])
```
**Step 2: Create an Index*

Use the Vertex AI Vector Search UI or API to create an index. Choose the appropriate distance metric (cosine, dot product, etc.).

```bash
gcloud ai indexes create \
  --display-name="my-vector-index" \
  --metadata-file=index-config.json \
  --region=us-central1
```
Sample index-config.json:

```json
{
  "dimensions": 768,
  "approximateNeighborsCount": 150,
  "distanceMeasureType": "DOT_PRODUCT"
}
```

**Step 3: Upload Vectors**
You can insert your embeddings into the index using the Vertex AI Index Endpoint.

```bash
gcloud ai indexes add-contents \
  --index="my-vector-index" \
  --contents=embeddings.json \
  --region=us-central1
```

**Step 4: Query the Vector Index**
Once your data is indexed, your agent can send queries (as vectors) to retrieve the most relevant results.

```python
query_embedding = model.get_embeddings(["Find similar articles about AI"])[0]
# Use the Vertex endpoint to retrieve similar vectors
```

### Integration in Agent Workflows
- Use Vector Search with:
- CrewAI memory or knowledge module.
- LangChain retrievers (via custom wrapper).
- Flowise RAG nodes.

#### When to Use
- ✅ You need high-scale, low-latency search.
- ✅ You have millions of embeddings and want serverless infra.
- ✅ You want tight integration with other Vertex AI tools.

### Notes
- Each index has a region scope, make sure your queries and data load match the same region.
- For better results, normalize vectors and choose the right distance metric.
- Combine with metadata filtering to allow hybrid search (vector + keywords).
