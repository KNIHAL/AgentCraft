# üß† Vertex AI Workbench
Vertex AI Workbench is a managed Jupyter-based environment on Google Cloud that helps you develop, train, and deploy ML models or AI agents using pre-integrated tools and frameworks. It‚Äôs an ideal starting point for AI Agent Developers who want to prototype, build, and test directly in the cloud.

## ‚úÖ Why Use Vertex AI Workbench?

- No local setup required ‚Äî everything runs in the cloud.
- Supports GPUs, TPUs, and custom VM configurations.
- Comes pre-installed with popular ML/AI libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face, and more.
- Integrated with Vertex AI services like datasets, training pipelines, models, and endpoints.
- Seamlessly connects with BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and GitHub.

#### üöÄ Quick Start
1. Go to Vertex AI > Workbench in the Google Cloud Console.

2. Click "New Notebook" and choose from:

    * User-managed Notebooks (flexible, full control)
    * Managed Notebooks (GCP manages the infra for you)

3. Select:

    * Machine type (e.g., 4-core CPU, or GPU-based)
    * Environment (pre-built Deep Learning VM or custom container)

4. Launch the notebook and start coding.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Best Practices
- Use Cloud Storage buckets for saving models, datasets, and logs.
- Connect your notebook to GitHub for version control.
- Always shut down notebooks when not in use to avoid extra billing.
- Use IAM roles to manage access to the notebook and connected services.

#### üîê Permissions Needed

- Make sure the service account or user has the following roles:
    - Vertex AI User
    - Storage Admin or Storage Object Viewer
    - Notebook Admin (for creation and management)

- Make sure to enable the API of the WorkBench Notebook.

#### üß© Integration with Agent Development
**You can treat Workbench as your cloud-based IDE for:**
- Designing multi-agent workflows
- Debugging tool usage and agent plans
- Interacting with external APIs from a safe environment
- Training or evaluating tool-augmented LLMs
